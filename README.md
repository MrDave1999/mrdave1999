I was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, I'm a very passionate engineer and dedicated to his work. What motivated me to learn programming was [SA-MP](https://sa-mp.mp) (San Andreas Multiplayer, a multiplayer mod for GTA San Andreas), since I was 16 years old I always wanted to create my gamemode on this platform, for this reason, I committed myself to learn Pawn (it is a programming language, only it is not so well known) to achieve this goal. Good thing I knew about the existence of [SA-MP](https://www.sa-mp.mp), otherwise, I would never have been interested in programming.

Active since years in the open source community, especially in the .NET ecosystem.

**I have created the following open source projects:**
- [DentallApp](https://github.com/DentallApp) - A web application that manages appointment scheduling, reminders and cancellation of appointments.
- [DotEnv.Core](https://github.com/MrDave1999/dotenv.core) - A class library for read and parsing .env files.
- [YeSQL.NET](https://github.com/ose-net/yesql.net) - A class library for loading SQL statements from .sql files instead of writing SQL code in your C# source files.
- [SimpleResults](https://github.com/MrDave1999/SimpleResults) - A .NET library that provides new error handling using the [Result pattern](https://medium.com/@wgyxxbf/result-pattern-a01729f42f8c) without using exceptions.
- [CPlugin.Net](https://github.com/MrDave1999/CPlugin.Net) - A simple library that allows to implement a plugin-based architecture for .NET.
- [Capture The Flag](https://github.com/MrDave1999/Capture-The-Flag) - A gamemode for SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) created with .NET/C# and [SampSharp.net](https://sampsharp.net/).
- [Seztion.Parser](https://github.com/MrDave1999/seztion-parser) - A class library used to read data from each section of a file (the file extension can be any, e.g. .INI).

  I like to know the why of things and I learned this from:

Thank you [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) for this great language :heart_eyes:
